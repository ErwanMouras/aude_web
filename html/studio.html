                    <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                    <p>Our work spans residential, hospitality, and commercial architecture, as well as furniture, lighting, and product design. Each project is approached with the same fundamental principles: respect for materials, consideration of human scale, and a deep understanding of how people inhabit space.</p>
                    <p>We believe that good design should be both functional and beautiful, creating environments that support well-being while expressing a clear aesthetic vision rooted in Scandinavian design traditions.</p>
